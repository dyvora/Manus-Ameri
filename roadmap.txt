Roadmap

Phase 0 – Pre-launch alignment
Pre-launch marketing foundation:
1. Finalize brand identity, waitlist landing page, analytics, CRM, and automation tooling to support the initial outreach plan.
2. Recruit beta testers from civic groups, universities, and online communities while preparing a comprehensive press kit for launch storytelling.
3. Define messaging pillars and voice guidelines to ensure all pre-launch materials reinforce clarity, empowerment, and trust for the target personas.

Phase 1 – MVP application build
Deliver single-file React MVP:
1. Implement the single-page App.jsx experience with Tailwind via CDN, using hooks to manage navigation between Home, Profile, and Calendar states.
2. Integrate Google Civic Information API for address lookups, establishing loading and error handling states for reliability.
3. Build Profile view to fetch ProPublica and News API data, presenting summaries and recent news tabs with responsive design standards.
4. Populate Calendar view with static federal election milestones and ensure navigation coherence across the app.

Phase 2 – Launch readiness
Coordinate launch campaign:
1. Produce launch blog, press release, webinar, and social activations timed with product release, aligning with #KnowYourRep messaging.
2. Set referral incentives and onboarding flows, incorporating tooltips or email drips to highlight core features at first use.
3. Prepare tracking dashboards covering acquisition, engagement, and retention metrics for launch day baselines.

Phase 3 – Post-launch growth (Months 1-6)
Scale audience and partnerships:
1. Execute weekly content marketing and SEO initiatives targeting civic literacy themes while optimizing metadata and load performance.
2. Run targeted paid campaigns around key political events and deploy retargeting to recover drop-offs at profile view stage.
3. Secure partnerships with educators, nonprofits, and libraries, delivering co-branded toolkits and onboarding cohorts for advocacy programming.
4. Launch feedback loops inside the product and via surveys to collect qualitative insights for backlog prioritization.

Phase 4 – Measurement & iteration (Months 6-12)
Optimize product-market fit:
1. Conduct quarterly KPI reviews with marketing and product teams, refining channel mix and feature roadmap based on analytics and user feedback.
2. Expand nationwide media outreach and advanced personalization features (e.g., alerts) informed by usage data and partnership learnings.
3. Maintain governance around data accuracy, neutrality, and privacy to protect brand trust as scale increases.
